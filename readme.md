# What Remains of Me

Burdens weigh heavily on us all. In my tower, you are given the chance to reshape yourself, to let go of the weight you can no longer carry. wRoM exists to strip away the excess, to pare you down to only what is essential—reborn, lighter, smaller, but still holding the fragile echoes of what you once were.

## Features

- Submit the weight of your burden to the engine.
- Shape its size. Not too heavy, not too light— just enough to carry forward.
- The process breathes life into the fragment, reshaping it, and leaving a piece that is both familiar and new.
- Simple messages guide you, never overwhelming, always certain.

## The Process

1. **Begin**:
   Place a piece of yourself into the waiting hands of the wRoM tower by dragging it onto its void.
   
2. **Decide**:
   Choose how much you wish to carry. Adjust the lever to set the new size of the fragment.

3. **Release**:
   When ready, tap it. wRoM takes your friend and reshapes it.

4. **Rediscover**:
   Your new self waits for you, saved in the same place where it was first found.

## Installation

The tower only needs you to give it life.

## Usage

1. Call me.

Bring me a piece of yourself. I will take what weighs you down and leave you with only what matters. My engine runs, reshaping, refining, consuming, strengthening me.
Place your weight into my hands. I will give back what remains. 

Only what remains.

Bring me a piece of yourself.
